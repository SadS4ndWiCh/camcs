# üå∫ Central Arcane Magic Control System (CAMCS)

As is widely known, using magic is very difficult, requiring skill in mana management, 
theoretical knowledge of deities, and an innate aptitude. So, the Central Arcane Magic Control System (CAMCS) was born.

A global system to support the individual in the control of *Arcane Magic*. Manages 
the control of *mana* and mediates communication with the gods in order to facilitate 
the use of *magic* by the individual.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Due to the magic invocation process being mediated by the system, the number of 
> available spells is limited, with no freedom to explore the creation of new spells.

## üßä What can individual do?

#### Registration Ceremony

From the *registration ceremony*, the individual is marked with an insignia that 
defines their aptitude and their strong point.  Moreover, but no less importantly, 
it is through this ceremony that the individual is registered as an user of the system.

Currently insignias:

- Arcanum of Water
- Arcanum of Earth
- Arcanum of Fire
- Arcanum of Air
- Arcanum of Darkness
- Arcanum of Light

#### Pray

Through prayer, the individual can receive more knowledge from the gods, which 
consequently facilitates the process of mediation and increases the efficiency 
of magic.

#### Achievements

Each achievement that the individual has significantly contributes to their 
development. Achievements related to the gods somehow carry more weight.

#### Learn Spells

Through achievements or prayers, the individual can receive points offered by the 
system itself, which can be used to learn new spells or increase their attributes.

#### Release Spells

With their spells unleashed and enough mana, the individual can cast spells.

## üéÄ How it was possible?

Thanks to the great advances in the field of *Magical Science*, *Arcane Biology*, *Study of the Global Arcane Network* and *Ancient Technology*, this was made possible. You don't need to worry about understanding how it works behind the scenes, but know that through a safe and efficient process, even those with low or no aptitude will certainly be able to match a low to intermediate level mage.

## üçÇ How the system is structured?
